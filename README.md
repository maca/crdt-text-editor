CRDT Colaborative Editor
-----------------------

Proof of concept of a collaborative text editor based on
[https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace](Ace code editor) using CRDTs.

This project is written mostly in Elm and serves an example to
demostrate the use of
[https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/maca/crdt-replicated-tree/latest/](maca/crdt-replicated-tree)
Elm library.

Instructions to run locally to come.
